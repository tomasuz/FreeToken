"""ggml quant type constants, block geometry and the GGUF format registry.

Pure data with no FreeToken imports. It lives at the package root rather than under
``freetoken.models`` because the MoE offload cache needs it, and importing anything
from ``freetoken.models`` initialises the whole model stack -- which imports the MoE
layer, which imports the offload cache. ``models.gguf.dequant`` re-exports every name
here, so existing imports keep working.
