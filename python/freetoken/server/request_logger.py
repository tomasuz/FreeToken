"""Optional inbound-request and generated-response logging.

When the ``FREETOKEN_API_LOG_DIR`` environment variable is set, every request that is
dispatched to one of the API handlers (``/v1/chat/completions``,
``/v1/completions``, ``/v1/messages``, ``/v1/responses``, ``/generate``) is
appended as one JSON record per line to a per-process
``requests-<start>-<pid>.jsonl`` file under that directory. (Requests rejected
by FastAPI's body validation never reach a handler, so they are not recorded.)

The same file also gets one record per finished generation (streamed or not),
written by ``log_response`` from ``generation.py``'s ``generate_events`` /
``generate_full`` -- the one place every wire protocol (OpenAI, Anthropic,
Responses) converges, so this covers all of them without each adapter logging
its own wire shape. A response record's ``reasoning`` field is the model's
thinking/reasoning-channel text (empty when the model or request has none);
``content`` is the final answer text. Match a request to its response by
``uid`` (the response's ``uid``, also the numeric suffix of wire ids like
``chatcmpl-<uid>``) and by adjacency -- requests carry no uid of their own,
since one is not assigned until after the request is logged.

Records are handed to a dedicated background writer thread through a bounded
in-memory queue, so a slow / full / network-backed log filesystem can never
block the server's single async event loop; if the queue fills (pathologically
slow disk) records are dropped rather than applying backpressure to serving.
When the variable is unset the hooks are a no-op with effectively zero overhead,
so call sites can invoke :func:`log_request` unconditionally.

A logging failure must never break request handling, so the enqueue path
swallows every error (warning at most once).
